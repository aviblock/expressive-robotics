# Communicating Lane Change Intent 
[This paper](Communicating%20Lane%20Change%20Intent.pdf), lead authored by Seonghee Lee, describes research conducted in Virtual Reality about motion dynamic-based behaviors through which an autonomous vehicle can indicate its desire to change lanes in traffic.

# Design Factors for Pedestrian-AV Interaction at Crosswalks
[This paper](AV%20Interaction%20with%20First%20Responders.pdf), lead authored by Avram Block, describes research conducted in Virtual Reality about the design of visual displays (eHMI) used to give pedestrians a sense of comfort and safety when crossing in front of an autonomous vehicle.

# AV Interaction with First Responders
[This paper](Pedestrian-AV%20Interaction%20Design%20Factors.pdf), lead authored by Seonghee Lee, describes research conducted through a series of interviews with various First Responders on how best to provide them with critical information about the autonomous vehicle's state in instances of failure/degradation requiring intervention.
