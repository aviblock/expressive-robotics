# Communicating Lane Change Intent - HRI '23 LBR
[This paper](Communicating%20Lane%20Change%20Intent.pdf), lead authored by Seonghee Lee, describes research conducted in Virtual Reality about motion dynamic-based behaviors through which an autonomous vehicle can indicate its desire to change lanes in traffic.

# Design Factors for Pedestrian-AV Interaction at Crosswalks
[This paper](AV%20Interaction%20with%20First%20Responders.pdf), lead authored by Avram Block, describes research conducted in Virtual Reality about the design of visual displays (eHMI) used to give pedestrians a sense of comfort and safety when crossing in front of an autonomous vehicle.

# AV Interaction with First Responders - HRI '23 LBR
[This paper](Pedestrian-AV%20Interaction%20Design%20Factors.pdf), lead authored by Seonghee Lee, describes research conducted through a series of interviews with various First Responders on how best to provide them with critical information about the autonomous vehicle's state in instances of failure/degradation requiring intervention.

# Challenges and Opportunities in AV-Vulnerable Road User Interaction - AAAI Spring Symposium '23 Full Length Paper
[This paper](Challenges_with_AV_VRU_Interaction.pdf), lead authored by Avram Block, provides an overview of the current state of research and collaboration on applying HRI principles to the interaction between autonomous vehicles and all other road users. We acknowledge the challenges to furthering this work, and make recommendations regarding particularly impactful gaps to be filled.
